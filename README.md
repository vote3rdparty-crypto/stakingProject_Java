# stakingProject_Java
Student long term staking project in JavaScript


This is an extremely simple interface for what I hope will be something I can continue to work on until it's slicker than snot on a doorknob.

Upon loading the page, please open up your console. 

Then simply follow directions on screen. 

Guess heads or tails just by pressing the button!

That's it!

I could not figure out how to store the value the user inputs into the "Asset" field. That is the one glaring flaw I can pinpoint for myself.

I want to keep this project going as a work-in-progress. 

Thanks for your input!
